# Sorting-Algorithm
Created a custom sorting algorithm that selects a different algorithm based on the size of a particular array.


I use cmake as my build system so if you are not familiar with cmake and want to run then follow along below.

1. Make a folder that has all dependents 
2. Navigate in your terminal to the folder
3. $ mkdir build
4. $ cd build
5. $ cmake ..
If built sucessfully.... 
6. $ make
7. $ ./sort
